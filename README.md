# Albert

This is the program to measure the core size of the core-shell gel in the optical microscopic image of Albert's microfluidics device.

The implementation is
1. locate the wells
2. detect the edges 
3. find the smallest best fitting circle near the center of the wells

Set the minimal radius of the core size and the detection limit by changing the two parameters on the top.
